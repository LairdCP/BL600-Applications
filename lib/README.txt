Laird Technologies 2013

This folder contains smartBASIC source code which the customer should
treat as a read-only library.

Files in this folder will change without notice.

If you find a bug or need to make modification, then it is recommended
that you either make the change and submit to Laird so that it gets
reflected back to you at the next release, OR you copy and rename the
file to another folder and take permanent ownership.
