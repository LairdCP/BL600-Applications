//Example Script "helloworld" (See in BL600CodeSnippets.zip)
 
DIM i as integer 					//declare our variable
 
for i=1 to 10 				 		//Perform the print ten times
print "Hello World ";i;"\n"			//The \n forces a new line each time
									//The ;i; prints integer i directly 
//after "Hello World " 
next 								//Increment the value of i
