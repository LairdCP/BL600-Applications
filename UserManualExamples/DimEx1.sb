DIM temp1 AS INTEGER
DIM temp2 						//Will be an INTEGER by default
DIM temp3$ AS STRING
DIM temp4$ 						//Will be a STRING by default
DIM temp5$ AS INTEGER 		//Allowed but not recommended practice as there 
//is a $ at end of name
DIM temp6 AS STRING 			//Allowed but not recommended practice as no $ 
//at end of name
DIM a1,a2,a3$,a4 				//3 INTEGER variables and 1 STRING variable
 
print "We will now print each varaible on screen \n"
print temp1, temp2, temp3$, temp4$, temp5$, temp6, a1, a2, a3$, a4

//Since the variables have not been instantiated, they hold default values
//The comma inserts a TAB
